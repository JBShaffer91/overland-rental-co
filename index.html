  <h3>Subaru Out-there-and-back</h3>
    <img src="subaru-outback-wilderness-overland.jpg" alt="Subaru Outback Wilderness Overland">
      <p>As promised, the Subaru Outback. Built to get you to your happy place and back. Outfitted with:
        <ul>
          <li>Rally light bar for low light environments</li>
          <li>Body Armor SU-19340 winch kit with a 5,000 lbs winch</li>
          <li>Thule Extended Cargo Carrier to free up extra interior space</li>
        </li>Plenty of interior protection for your peace of mind</li>
        <li>Wireless charger with bluetooth</li>
      </ul>
      This car blends in seamlessly in an urban setting, making the occassional overnighter in a Cabella's parking lot on your way to the mountain safe and incognito, but it's rugged enough for an intimate off road adventure for two.</p>

  <h3>Toyota Tacoma TRD Pro</h3>
    <img src="tacoma-overland-2.jpg" alt="Toyota Tacoma TRD Pro Overland">
      <p>The Toyota Tacoma may very well be the Gold Standard for overland builds, and ours definitely won't leave you wanting. This one's sporting:
        <ul>
          <li>Linear shocks with a spacer lift for those hard-to-reach places</li>
          <li>33" tires</li>
          <li>In-house custom cut fender flares</li>
          <li>In-house fabricated roof and bed racks
          <li>Midland MicroMobile® MXT400 40-watt GMRS radio</li>
          <li>Thule Basin Wedge hard shell rooftop tent</li>
        </ul>
        We promise you'll have enough tools at your disposal to reach the most remote places with ease.

  <h3>Mercedes Sprinter Expedition</h3>
    <img src="mercedes-sprinter-expedition.jpg" alt="Mercedes Sprinter Extreme Overland">
      <p>This is not your average Sprinter van, nor is it your average RV. This van falls somewhere between The Wild Thornberry's ComVee and a MIL-SPEC HMMWV.
        <h4>Exterior</h4>
        <li>It's covered from head to toe in Line-X to prevent scratches</li>
        <li>and a big brush bar for you to blaze your own trail (wherever it's not harmful to local wildlife)
        <li>No off road vehicle is complete without a 12,000-pound winch</li>
        <li>A side ladder will take you to the full-length roof rack up top</li>
        <li>and there's a nifty toolbox and spare tire are mounted on the back, just in case.</li>
        <li>This van's drivetrain has also been converted to a 4x4 with a Dana 60 front axel and a Dana 70 in the rear</li>
        <li>as well as hub lockers to make sure this big beast never gets stuck.</li>
        <li>Just for good measure though, we have it sitting on 37" tires and the ride height is 8.5" taller, too.</li>
        <h4>Interior</h4>
        <li>40 gallon water tank</li>
        <li>600 amp hours worth of battery power</li>
        <li>electric glass cooktop</li>
        <li>front and rear heating</li>
        <li>20" Amazon Fire TV (don't worry, we'll check to make sure you're signed out when you get back).</li>
      </p>
